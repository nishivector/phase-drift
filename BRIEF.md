# Phase Drift — Round 12 Brief

**ONE VERB:** PHASE

**GAME IN 10 WORDS:** Signal ghost phases between two overlapping worlds to reach exit

**WHAT THE PLAYER MASTERS:** Reading which layer a threat inhabits before committing to a phase-switch — the learnable skill is building and holding a live mental map of Layer B while navigating Layer A, then predicting the safe window before toggling

**THE WOW MOMENT:** On stage 4, both layers flash simultaneously visible for exactly 1.8 seconds before one collapses — for the first time you see the complete maze and realise the exit you've been circling is directly behind you in the layer you keep abandoning

**WHY RICARDO:** Metal Gear (you always know two worlds coexist; you never know where the threat lives in the invisible one until you commit and it's too late) + Wipeout (phase commits are instantaneous and punishing — the ghost of your mistake is visible on the floor, you read it and go again)

**EMOTIONAL ARC:**
- Start: Two clicks, two deaths into a wall — the rule is understood in under 20 seconds with zero text; confusion lasts exactly one life
- Groove: Mastery feels like collapsing two maps into a single 3D space you move through fluidly — you stop thinking "switch" and start thinking "depth"
- Climax: The final chamber has a pursuer that phase-shifts on its own timer; you must outpace its rhythm while maintaining your own — two clocks, one body, three seconds of safe window shrinking to one

**WHAT MAKES IT HARD:** You see only one layer at a time; threats in the invisible layer must be inferred from audio cues and faint trail-shadows bleeding through the membrane — the cognitive load is sustaining a mental model you cannot verify without dying

**SKILL CEILING:** 1x player reacts to what is visible, dies repeatedly to the invisible layer, phases frantically. 10x player reads trail-shadows and audio pitch to predict enemy layer-positions two moves ahead, phases in continuous arcs without stopping — movement never breaks

**VISUAL:** `#0A0F1E` `#00E5FF` `#FF3366` — top-down tilted isometric, geometry hard-edged and sparse; Tron Legacy architecture dissolving into fog

**AUDIO:** 116 BPM, slow sub-bass heartbeat that accelerates when a threat is close in the opposite layer; signature SFX: a crystalline snap on phase-switch with a 0.3-second reverb tail — the tail stretches to 0.6 seconds when something unseen is within striking range

**NOT:**
- Not a dual-world puzzle where you place objects to bridge the gap between layers
- Not a platformer where gravity reverses on a cooldown timer
